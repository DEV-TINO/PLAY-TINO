This interactive web application is designed to provide users with fun and engaging activities through three main features: the Cat World Cup, the Time Matching Game, and the Nonsense/General Knowledge Quiz. Whether you're a cat lover, a reflex enthusiast, or a trivia buff, there's something here for everyone.

## Features

### 1. Cat World Cup
The Cat World Cup is a tournament-style game where you get to choose your favorite cat among many adorable and lovely cat photos. The game proceeds through a series of rounds, starting with 16 cats. In each round, you select your favorite cat between two contenders until you arrive at your ultimate top pick. This feature is perfect for cat enthusiasts looking to indulge in a fun and interactive way to enjoy cute cat pictures.

### 2. Time Matching Game
Test your reflexes and precision with the Time Matching Game. The objective is to match a randomly given time as closely as possible. You'll be provided with a specific time, and your task is to press a button exactly at that moment. This game challenges your concentration and reaction speed, making it a great way to sharpen your reflexes.

### 3. Nonsense/General Knowledge Quiz
Challenge your brain with a mix of nonsense and general knowledge questions. This quiz consists of 10 questions‚Äî5 nonsense and 5 general knowledge. The nonsense questions are designed to be humorous and require creative thinking, while the general knowledge questions test your common knowledge and logic. Compete with friends to see who is the wittiest and who has the most knowledge!
